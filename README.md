CS-230 Portfolio 
For this course, submit the completed software design document that you created for your client, The Gaming Room, into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. This completed design document demonstrates your ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and to communicate it effectively to a client and your development team members.

Once you have submitted your software design document, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
